Objective of the Assignment
    •    Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit.
    •    Categorize temperatures as Cold, Cool, Warm, or Hot.
    •    Analyze a set of temperatures, calculate the average, and display results.

Summary of Guidance and Learning Process

Step-by-Step Approach
    1.    Celsius to Fahrenheit Conversion
    •    Guided on using the formula (celsius * 9/5) + 32.
    •    Explained how to create a Swift function returning a Double.
    2.    Temperature Categorization
    •    Explained use of if / else if / else to categorize temperatures.
    •    Optional enhancement: Added “Warning” messages for extreme temperatures (freezing <0°C, heatwave >24°C).
    3.    Analyzing Temperatures
    •    Guided on iterating through an array of temperatures rather than a full range to reduce output.
    •    Helped calculate the sum and average correctly, using Double conversions.
    •    Included both Celsius and Fahrenheit in print outputs.

⸻

Debugging & Refinement
    •    Fixed errors related to variable scope and type conversion (Int vs Double).
    •    Adjusted loops to avoid extra or repetitive output.
    •    Encouraged testing different ranges and examples to verify correctness.

⸻

Final Implementation Highlights
    •    Functions: celsiusToFahrenheit(celsius:), categorizeTemperature(celsius:), analyzeTemperatures(samples:).
    •    Output includes:
    •    Each temperature in °C and °F.
    •    Category label (Cold, Cool, Warm, Hot).
    •    Average temperature of the sample set in °C and °F.
    •    Sample array of 10 temperatures used for concise output.

⸻

Learning Methodology
    •    Used guided multiple-choice hints to make decisions.
    •    Emphasized trial, error, and debugging rather than copying answers.
    •    Gained hands-on experience with loops, conditionals, functions, and type conversions in Swift.

    •    The completed playground file is submitted via Teams as instructed.
